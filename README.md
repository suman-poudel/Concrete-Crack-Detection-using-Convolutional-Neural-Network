# Concrete-Crack-Detection
This repository contains a CNN model that helps to detect concrete crack.
The dataset was downloaded in zip format from website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection

The archive.zip file is from the above link.
Due to lack of computational resources only 8,000 (negative/no cracks: 4,000 and positive/cracks: 4,000) of the image dataset were used out of 40,000 (negative/no cracks: 20,000 and positive/cracks: 20,000).

The CNN model built for the project was inspired from the Siamese Network. Link to paper: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf

The model built can be clearly explained from the picture below:

This project idea was inspired from the github: https://github.com/konskyrt/Concrete-Crack-Detection-Segmentation/tree/main

Here are some output results from my Google Colab

In future, I will explore in crack depth prediction
